##Introduction

The current study seeks to replicate findings from "Replication of Inferring Whether Officials Are Corruptible From Looking at Their Faces." I chose to replicate this study because it is outside my area of study (social psychology), but not my field (psychology). I currently study children's language development as a function of environmental factors such as auditory noise and have never had the opportunity to study adult behavior. In experiment 1 of this study, the researchers explored how adults used photos of unfamiliar state and federal officials to determine an official's level of agression, deception, and corruptibility. Results indicated that state and federal officials who were convicted of political corruption were viewed as more dishonest asnd deceptive than their peers with clean records. 

##Methods
To replicate this experiment, I will need to collect 72 images of Caucasian male federal or state elected officials- 36 convicted and 36 with clean records. All officials must have served between 2002 and 2017 (in line with the original paper, which selected officials who served between 2001 and 2016). All images are presented in grayscale above a 5-point Likert scale. The scale is labeled with one of five word sets- corruptible/incorruptible, dishonest/honest, selfish/selfless, trustworthy/untrustworthy, and generous/ungenerous. At the beginning of each trial, a fixation cross flashes on the screen for .5-1.5s followed by an elected official's photo for 1s. Participants have 4 additional seconds to submit their rating. At the very end of the experiment (after completing 5 blocks of ratings), participants are asked if they were familiar with any of the presented officials. Trials in which participants indicated familiarity are excluded from analysis. 
The most challenging part of completing this replication study will be creating the set of photos/Likert scales to be uploaded to Mechanical Turk. Fortunately, the authors have provided additional information regarding their methods on OSF.

###Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

###Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

###Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

###Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

####Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
